# Project Title

ChatBook Web App

## Description

This project is a real-time post-making web application developed as a learning exercise based on the MERN stack. It enables users to create accounts, log in, view and react to other users' posts, and create, edit and delete their own posts. An alert functionality is also included for each action. However, some features are not yet connected with the backend and require further development.

## Installation

To install this project, clone the repository onto your local machine, open the project in your preferred IDE, and execute the following commands:

```
npm install 
cd Backend 
npm install
cd ..
npm run dev
```

If any dependencies are missing, you can install them using npm and the `package.json` files provided in the project and backend folders. Once all dependencies have been installed, run the command \`npm run dev\` to start the application.

Please make a new cluster in MongoDB; the previous one may have been terminated, and include that API in the key.js file of the config folder at the Backend folder.

## Usage

To tailor this application for your own purposes, you may need to make several changes on the frontend. We suggest adding more features such as a user profile page, chat functionality, and other scalable features.

We welcome contributions to this project. To make changes, please fork the repository, create a new branch, make your changes, and submit a pull request. Contributions can include improvements to the frontend, creating new backend APIs, and integrating frontend features with the backend. Additionally, if you encounter any bugs or issues, please feel free to create an issue on the repository, and we will do our best to resolve it.
